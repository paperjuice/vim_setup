# Vim_setup

### Description
This is just a tiny bash script that I run whenever I want to setup vim on a new machine. </br>
This is, of course, what I *personally* like to have for my vim setup. </br>
I can be ran on both centos or mac(with brew).
The .vimrc in this repo is deprecated. I have a separate repo with the .vimrc found [here](https://github.com/paperjuice/.vimrc.git)


### What it contains?
By running the bash script you will get a small .vimrc file which is a vim custom config file
Plus, the following packages:
* ###### [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) - Vim package manager
* ###### [vim-elixir](https://github.com/elixir-editors/vim-elixir) - Elixir code syntax
* ###### [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - Shows status bar
* ###### [vim-better-white-space](https://github.com/ntpeters/vim-better-whitespace) - Shows if there are triling white spaces
* ###### [vim-nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) - Directory explorer
* ###### [vim-supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) - Autocomplete by pressing the TAB key
* ###### [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) - Git integration

* ###### [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) - Ack integration
